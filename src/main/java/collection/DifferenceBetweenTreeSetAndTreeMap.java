/*
Main Difference between TreeMap and TreeSet is that TreeMap is an implementation of Map interface while TreeSet is an implementation of Set interface
TreeMap and TreeSet are non synchronized Collection, hence can not be shared between multiple threads.
Iterator returned by TreeMap and TreeSet are fail-fast, means they will throw ConcurrentModificationException when TreeMap or TreeSet is modified structurally once Iterator is created.
