/**
 * Java program to demonstrate How to use CountDownLatch in Java. CountDownLatch is
 * useful if you want to start main processing thread once its dependency is completed
 * as illustrated in this CountDownLatch Example
 *
 *
 * - CountDownLatch is a synchronization utility, which allows any Thread to wait for certain number of events, triggered by different thread.
 *
 * - When each event happens, The Thread which completes that event, calls countDown() method of this class. Which reduces count by one.
 * When count reach zero, which confirms that all event has completed, waiting thread wakes up and do its job.

        // and wait until count reaches zero. each thread once up and read will do
        // a count down. this will ensure that main thread is not started processing
        // until all services is up.
